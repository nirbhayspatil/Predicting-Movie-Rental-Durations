# Predicting-Movie-Rental-Durations

A DVD rental company needs your help! They want to figure out how many days a customer 
will rent a DVD for based on some features and has approached you for help. They want you to 
try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent 
a DVD for. The company wants a model that yields an MSE of 3 or less on a test set. 
The model you make will help the company become more efficient in inventory planning.

The data they provided is in the csv file rental_info.csv. It has the following features:

* **rental_date:** The date (and time) the customer rents the DVD.  
* **return_date:** The date (and time) the customer returns the DVD.  
* **amount:** The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD.  
* **amount_2:** The square of "amount".  
* **rental_rate:** The rate at which the DVD is rented for.  
* **rental_rate_2:** The square of "rental_rate".  
* **release_year:** The year the movie being rented was released.  
* **length:** length of the movie being rented, in minutes.  
* **length_2:** The square of "length".  
* **replacement_cost:** The amount it will cost the company to replace the DVD.  
* **special_features:** Any special features, for example, trailers/deleted scenes that the DVD also has.

**NC-17, PG, PG-13, R:** These columns are dummy variables of the rating of the movie. It takes the value 1 if the move is rated as the column name and 0 otherwise.
